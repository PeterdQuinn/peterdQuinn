Hello, my name is Peter Quinn. I recently graduated the University of Arizona coding bootcamp earning a certificate in Full Stack Web Development. I am currently looking for work as a MERN or React developer.
 During my recent and intensive coursework, I gained experience in the following:
Html/CSS/Git/Advanced CSS -JavaScript/jQuery -Web API'S -Third-Party API's -Server-side APIs -Node.js -Object- Oriented-Programming (OOP) -Express.js -SQL -Object-Relational-Mapping (ORM) -Model-View-Controller (MVC) -NoSQL -Progressive Web Applications (PWA) -React -MERN ( Mango, Express, React, Node ) -Tailwinds CSS -Handlebars -Restful Servers -JSON -GraphQl Server
My background begins as a student-athlete in high school where I was lucky to be a part of a championship basketball team as early as 13 years old. Completing all necessary high school course work at 15, I chose to stay enrolled until I was 18 in order to continue playing sports. After high school, I began working with children with autism and gradually extended my expertise to include adults, ages 18 to 33.  In that time, I was able to win another basketball championship, this time as a coach for the Special Olympics. After a decade of working within this behavioral niche I have been inspired to change directions and am following a path and passion transitioning into computers and technology.
