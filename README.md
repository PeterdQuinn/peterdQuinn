## The Work

I run **[Full Stack Services LLC](https://www.fullstackservicesllc.net)**, where we build platforms that scale and infrastructure that doesn't break. Most developers can build a website. I architect entire ecosystems—from frontend to database to cloud deployment—that handle real traffic, real users, and real money.

**What that actually means:**
- You're launching an e-commerce platform that needs to handle thousands of concurrent users? Built it.
- Migrating legacy systems to the cloud without downtime? Done it 70,000+ times.
- Need blockchain integration that doesn't look like a tech demo? I've shipped production Web3 apps.
- SEO, automation, custom dashboards, API integrations—if it touches the web, I've probably built it.

I work with companies that need more than just code. They need someone who understands the full picture: business logic, user experience, infrastructure costs, and how to scale without rebuilding everything in six months.

```

### What I've Built

**Enterprise Infrastructure**  
Designed and deployed multi-site content management systems handling millions in revenue. Built the backend architecture, optimized the frontend, managed the cloud infrastructure, and automated the marketing workflows. Everything worked together because one person understood the full stack.

**Cloud Migration at Scale**  
Led a 70,000+ item migration to Google Cloud Platform for a major cannabis industry client. Zero downtime. Zero data loss. The kind of project where you get one shot to get it right.

**E-Commerce That Converts**  
Custom Shopify integrations, abandoned cart automation, SEO optimization, and conversion rate improvements for high-volume retailers. Because a beautiful site that doesn't sell is just expensive art.

**Web3 & Blockchain**  
Actual production smart contracts and dApp development. Not crypto hype—real applications with real users interacting with the blockchain.

**Marketing Automation**  
Campaigns reaching 120K+ users across multiple states. Email sequences, customer segmentation, analytics dashboards, and integration with existing CRM systems.

## What I'm Looking For

Interesting problems. Complex systems. Projects where "just hire a developer" isn't going to cut it.

I work best with:
- **Startups** that need a technical co-founder or lead developer who can build v1 without burning runway
- **Growing companies** hitting infrastructure limits and needing someone who's scaled systems before
- **Established businesses** ready to modernize their stack or migrate to better platforms
- **Web3 projects** that need someone who understands both the tech and the business model

Not interested in:
- Simple brochure sites (unless they're part of a larger platform)
- Projects with no budget but "great exposure"
- Agencies looking for cheap contractors

## Let's Talk

Building something complex? Need a second opinion on your tech stack? Want to know if your current infrastructure can scale?

I'm always open to discussing interesting projects.
